INTRODUCTION                                                   *himarkdown.nvim*

Himarkdown.nvim is a plugin to decorate headers, dash, code block and quote on
markdown file. It adds highlights and changes markings on buffer. It depends on
'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter'.

The plugin logic is as simple as possible. The 'query' and 'captures' are two
keys in config that has strong relation. The 'query' is a treesitter query that
captures needed parts. Names of captures in the query should match with the
keys of 'captures'. Basically this plugin goes through 'captures' then creates
highlight groups named with prefix the "Himarkdown" followed by the each keys
of 'captures'. Afterwards it links captured elements by from 'query' to related
highlight definition under each key of 'captures'. If 'mark' exists then it
places the mark and if 'repeat_mark' is provided, it repeats the 'mark' that
many times.
